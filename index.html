            <h2><a href="#section1">Intro</a></h2>
              <p>Fr. Victor (1834-1897) was born in Ypres (Ieper) in Belgium, on 19.06.1834, the 3rd of four children of pious
              and deeply Christian parents. At home, he received a firm and virile formation which helped him to be
              courageous and not be afraid of any obstacle. He did his humanistic studies at St. Vincent's college in his
              native town of Ypres.</p>
            
            <a id="section2"></a>
            <h4><a href="#section2">Brother Victor of St. Antony</a></h4>
              <p>Brother Victor of St. Antony got admission to the Carmelite Monastery in his native town of Ypres. In 1852,
              he received his religious name of Brother Victor of St. Antony and made the vows. After doing
              philosophical-theological studies in Belgium, he received the priestly ordination in 1857.</p>
            
            <a id="section3"></a>
            <h4><a href="#section3">A missionary in India</a></h4>
              <p>In 1858, when he met his father in his sick bed, he gave him the last instruction: "Go, my child Charles,
              where God calls you. Be generous! Goodbye! Let us meet again in heaven". He wanted to be a missionary. He was
              sent to Rome to join the Seminary of Missions of the Carmelites. After some preliminary courses, he left Rome
              in September 1859 with his companions for his missionary field in India. They had arrived at Quilon, the
              centre of the Vicariate. Destined to work in South Travancore he had to study both Malayalam and Tamil. He did
              it with all the enthusiasm of a zealous young missionary. In 1860, while visiting the Vicariate he came to
              Mulagumoodu. At that time, Mulagumoodu was an unknown abandoned village, probably an abode of brigands. It was
              not a Catholic village though there were some Christians; there was nothing externally attractive. But Fr.
              Victor experienced an attraction to be there. He got permission from his Bishop and started the work. Fr.
              Victor and his brother Eugene converted more and more pagans and Hindus to Christianity. Sometimes whole
              villages responded positively to their appeal. Thousands of people voluntarily accepted Christianity through
              the love, affection, mercy, and grace of Fr. Victor.</p>
            
            <a id="section4"></a>
            <h4><a href="#section4">Builder of Churches</a></h4>
              <p>Fr. Victor bought 40 acres (16 hectares) of land at Mulagumoodu for the social development of the people.Fr. Victor and his brother Eugene planned and tried to execute their plan of changing the face of Mulagumoodu. In the end, they built nearly 20 churches, and the people of Mulagumoodu finally had a place to worship.</p>

            <a id="section5"></a>
            <h4><a href="#section5">Father of Orphans</a></h4>
              <p>1888 was a year of calamities for the whole district of Mulagumoodu and the neighbouring places. They had fallen into the grip of an epidemic of cholera. It increased the number of orphans. They wanted to build an orphanage. Eventually, they constructed one close to the church. However, there were no schools at that time. A school for them was a necessity. Near every church, they even built a school. By 1869, a small colony of families had come out of the orphanages. They called Fr. Victor the "Father of the poor and orphans".</p>

            <a id="section6"></a>
            <h4><a href="#section6">Founder of the convent of the Sisters</a></h4>
              <p>The administration of his orphanages and the womenfolk demanded the services of some religious Sisters. He arranged to receive service of the Canonesses St. Augustine of Ypres. The two brothers put their hands into the construction of an ample and worthy convent for them. In 1891, they laid the foundation stone and it took nearly six years to have it ready. The two brothers themselves became masons and carpenters. By the time the two volunteers, Marie Louise De-Meester and Marie Ursule reached Mulagumoodu on 7th November 1897 from Belgium to take possession of the newly constructed convent. The founder was no more to receive them. The convent they began at Mulagumoodu became later independent of the mother house; it became the cradle of a new Congregation called today ICM sisters.</p>

            <a id="section7"></a>
            <h4><a href="#section7">Higher Offices</a></h4>
              <p>An Apostolic Vicar of Mangalore, the Roman congregation of propaganda appointed him as Apostolic Administrator there in 1876. Fr. Victor was appointed by the Bishop in 1891 as his Vicar General of Quilon. He was also a man of influence with the civil authorities, local as well as colonial. But notwithstanding these high offices, he remained well attached to his first love of Mulagumoodu. He continued his missionary work of bringing more to accept the true light that came to illuminate all who came to him.</p>

            <a id="section8"></a>
            <h4><a href="#section8">Last days</a></h4>
              <p>Fr. Victor was strong in health. Hence, nobody thought of losing him so quickly. By 1897, while living at Mulagumoodu a painful sickness got hold of him. Yet his zeal made him not to care for it. One day when he was giving directions for the work of a new church at Mulagumoodu, he collapsed with a cerebral stroke. He did not murmur. He resigned himself to the loving hands of his Lord. Immediately they took him to to Quilon. His last words in Latin were: Salutat Te, Christe Jesu, miles tuus moriturus, translated as: "I am your dying soldier salutes you, Christ Jesus".</p>
